# Robo Rampage

Robo Rampage is my playground project for learning Godot 3D by building something fun. I am following the Udemy course **"Learn how to create 3D games from start to finish in Godot engine 4 and GDScript!"** while experimenting with my own tweaks.

## Project Facts
- **Engine:** Godot 4.5 (Forward+ renderer)
- **Focus:** Practice character controllers, cameras, and other 3D gameplay basics just for fun.

## How to Run
1. Install Godot 4.5 or newer (standard Forward+ build).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the folder in the Godot Project Manager and press **Play** to launch the sandbox level.

## Notes
- Input mappings live in `project.godot` (`jump`, `move_forward`, etc.). Feel free to rebind them through Project Settings > Input Map.
- Scripts stay heavily commented so I can revisit the logic later while continuing the Udemy lessons.
